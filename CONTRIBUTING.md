## Ways to Contribute

### Bug Reports

If you've found a bug, great! **Before you add an issue**, check if it is [already reported](https://github.com/timrodz/vscode-light_switch/issues).

### Code Refactoring

Pull requests beautifying code/correcting typos are also welcome.

### Enhancements

If you have any enhancement suggestions (be it minor improvements or completely new features), feel free to suggest them!

## Testing Changes

If you have added something new, create a test script for it.

Test scripts for this project are located in the test directory `src/test`. The test runner script `index.ts` executes all tests defined in files ending with `.test.ts` in the test directory. [More on VS Code Extension testing](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension)

### Add a Test Script

1. Create `src/test/<exampleFeature>.test.ts`:

```ts
import * as assert from 'assert';
import { before } from 'mocha';
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

suite('suiteName', () => {
  before(() => {
    // TODO: Add code to execute before test
  });

  test('Test name', () => {
    // TODO: Add testing code
    // Example: assert.equal(1, 2-1);
  });
});
```

2. Head to the debugging area and choose `Extension Tests` to [run the tests](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension/debug.mp4).
